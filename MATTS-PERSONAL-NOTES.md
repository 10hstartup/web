### Notes to me: this will eventually be moved somewhere else.

  1. The 'Framework' being used is the 'express' server.  View src/App.js and you will see it there.
  2. In the [i18next docs](https://www.i18next.com/overview/supported-frameworks), you can see express is listed, and actually there is a more general option just above it called "any http".
  3. Following [that link above](https://github.com/i18next/i18next-http-middleware), you find an example with the correct i18next integration procedure.  Follow it.
  4. Note also that [this guide on logging](https://www.twilio.com/blog/guide-node-js-logging) talks about logging with express.  Read and follow this too.
--> note: When getting a request (req), console.log WORKS, but it's in the terminal.
